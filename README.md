Regular Expression Based Word Pattern Detection
Description

This program implements regular expression techniques in Python to detect and extract word patterns from a given text. It demonstrates how regex can be effectively used to identify specific words, numeric patterns, fixed-length words, and suffix-based word matching, which are commonly used in Natural Language Processing tasks.

Program Overview

The program accepts predefined regular expression patterns and input text, then searches for matching words or patterns using Python’s re module. If matches are found, the detected patterns are displayed; otherwise, an appropriate message is shown.
